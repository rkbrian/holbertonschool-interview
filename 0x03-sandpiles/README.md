# 0x03. Sandpiles
Introduction of sandpiles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg
Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

 - Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
 - You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
 - A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
 - When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
 - grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
 - You’re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically

**Compiling command:** gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-sandpiles.c -o 0-sandpiles

**Example:**
3 3 3   1 3 1
3 3 3 + 3 3 3
3 3 3   1 3 1

4 6 4
6 6 6
